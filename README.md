Perovskite is the name of a mineral CaTiO3 and more broadly refers to the name of the structure adopted by this mineral.
The perovskite structure type is one of the most important in contemporary solid-state chemistry and is described usng the general formula ABX3, i.e. two cations A and B and 3 anions X (nearly always oxide or fluoride) per formula unit.
The importance of perovskite materials is a direct result of their structure, which causes a range of physical and chemical properties, and has led to their application as capacitors, supervonductors, and in the production of solar cells.
The diversity in properties found in perovskite is partly down to the ability of this structure to accommodate a vast array of different ions.

However, different ions and their associated properties may necessitate different distortions in the structure of the material in order to best accommodate their size and charge such that the material adopts the most stable structure. 
These distortions generally take the form of orthorhombic, rhombohedral, or tetrahedral perovskites, and these structural changes can have significant effects on the physical properties of the material, notably its electrical and magnetic properties.
It may therefore be of great value to be able to accurately predict the structure of as yet un-synthesised perovskites in predicting the proeprties and potential applications of new materials.
